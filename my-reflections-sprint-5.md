# My Reflections - Sprint Five


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?
i again got caught out trying to learn of the you tube video from gerard. I am not a good learner when it comes to you tube ao it ended up a mess the first time , but i tried without
the "asssistance" of you tube and just started writing my own code for it , when i got stuck , which was quite a lot , i had my brother with me for support and i know that if there is something he doesnt know
about javascript, and most other programming languages he will probably be learning it now . i feel i do have a bit of an advantage with his support , but he does teach others so he doesn't treat me any different to
anyone else, if anything he's probably harder on me than anyone.


### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?
many , this exersise really gave me a lot more knowledge about dry coding and algorithims.


# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

unfortunateley i didn't get to pair with anybody through the discord platform but i was able to get my brother to give advice throghout each challenge which was really my only option.


### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?

i think it will start out that way but i am getting used to using discord now and will be doing more reching out to other students for help, I do have a few 'friends' on dicord now but i have never been great at social media, that will change.
I understand that it must so it will.
