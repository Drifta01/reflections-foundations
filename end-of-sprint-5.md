# Final Reflections - Sprint Five

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

i guess it was the tic tac toe challenge. i enjoyed that

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

the seond and third sprints  were not good for me as  i did not take the time to properly read through the dev academy program and ended up missing quite a lot of lessons which meant i had to do more work
to catch up , whitch was very annoying, i think at the end of sprint five i have caught up on nearly all assignments , maybe a couple of the cuteral and emotional asssingnments, over all i think i have handled my paitience and
studied at a pace i know i am comfortable with.

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?
No i was not expecting as much of the emotional, cutural, self reflecting and reseaching on diffferent leaning methods like EQ and neuroplasticity but it was educational i will give it that.

### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?
i don't think i ever wanted to give up but i did find myself in a loop of frustration and tiredness , i guess that is where learning about the growth minset and learning compentencies helped ,
now i have a methid for dealing with any challenges that may start to frustrate me, it may not be exactly out of the EQ book but it works for me "Don;t sweat the small stuff" using this process of though really has helped me so far and i can only
hope it will throughout bootcamp.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?
i feel anxious as i am not exactly sure what to expect but i will go into bootcamp now with a lot more confidence than i had whaen i began.



### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

don't sweat the small stuff i'm sure


### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?
i couldn't say , maybe i can answer that in 10 weeks from now.. or ask the the future me.
